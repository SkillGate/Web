He always wanted to improve coding skills and good at self learning.Highlight:There was a time when he was challenged with a tasks which he did not know or never learned how to do it  but some of the teammates were experienced like professionals in doing that task. When we met Prasad next week, he planed it, improved it, written it, mastered it like a professional and delivered.  Then I invited him to come and deliver it to students in the future training programs to show how it is done.I highly recommend Prasad because he will take the ownership and help you grow from good to great!"
